# File Permissions 

Sudo Chown = change owner of file/directory
Sudo Chgrp = change group

Sudo chown new name for owner:new name for group filename.txt (changes owner and group at the same time -more efficient).

# For dir/folders:

Sudo chown -r  new name for owner:new name for group filename.txt
